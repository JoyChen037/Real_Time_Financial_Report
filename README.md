## Features
**Real-Time Data Processing**: We utilize Kafka for real-time data processing, ensuring that the dashboard displays the most current market data and updates without delay.

**Comprehensive Insights**: The dashboard provides a wide array of insights, including technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), fundamental indicators (e.g., earnings per share, P/E ratio), and the latest news relevant to the market.

**User-Friendly Interface**: We use Streamlit to create a user-friendly web-based interface, making it easy for investors, both new and experienced, to access and interpret the information presented.

**ETL Automation**: Airflow is employed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job scheduling, ensuring that the data is regularly updated and processed, maintaining the dashboard's accuracy and relevance.
